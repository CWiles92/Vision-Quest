# Vision-Quest
Hacker box 24 vision quest project 
this is my edit of grtyvr code for the hackerbox 24
in order to run the code for this project you will need to install the processing ide 
you can do this from here https://processing.org/ 
In processing go to the Sketch tab then import library then add library to install the needed librarys
If processing can't detect the correct serial connection edit the number in the [] on line 57
if processing wont pick up the sub camera try disabling any other cameras on your machine first
you can do this through device manager in windows 
if you need to edit the code on the arduino chip the arduino IDE can be downloaded from the microsoft store on windows
